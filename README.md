fun times proj with isaac

name comes later

## Ideas

* 3d visualization -ar. map space
 * VR first for simulate frequncy heatmaps
 * Goal: simulate listening environement at any venue. Sweep location of radar. 
   * idealy, radar connected to AR capable headset
   * probably use gps for alignment/ double check
* Use sonar or radar to map a physical space
  * what frequencies?
    * probably need to sweep up, and wait for echos to die first
  * Distance is measured in echos
  * 3d array of speakers for direction
* neural net could be applied to scanning data to make predictions
* use Isaacs hifi mics for POC

## to do list


* Lookup bat sonar, mechanics vs. capabilites.
* think about system in context of Machine Learning.
* look into PI for applicable SBIR - 3d sonar - 3d mapping 
* keep smallness on the mind 


### First Steps


1. research COTS options. Military implementations.
2. look ar arduino sonar stuff. Analyze code.


We probably want to start with hardware.

It is easier to stay motivated with tangible item

## old ideas

* neural net for arbitrary sound transformations
