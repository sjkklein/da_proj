fun times proj with isaac

name comes later

## Ideas

* 3d visualization -ar. map space
 * VR first for simulate frequncy heatmaps
 * Goal: simulate listening environement at any venue. Sweep location of radar. 
   * idealy, radar connected to AR capable headset
   * probably use gps for alignment/ double check
* Use sonar or radar to map a physical space
  * what frequencies?
    * probably need to sweep up, and wait for echos to die first
  * Distance is measured in echos
  * 3d array of speakers for direction
* neural net could be applied to scanning data to make predictions
* use Isaacs hifi mics for POC

## feel good

We probably want to start with hardware.
It is easier to stay motivated with tangible item


## to do list


* Lookup bat sonar, mechanics vs. capabilites.
* think about system in context of Machine Learning.
* look into PI for applicable SBIR - 3d sonar - 3d mapping 
* keep smallness on the mind 


### First Steps


1. research COTS options. Military implementations.
2. look ar arduino sonar stuff. Analyze code.
3. Focus on detecting single source of sound in a room.
4. proof of concept using python + recordings
        * Isaac has 3 identical mics. Make assembly, take recordings to look at data.
        * Take coordinte origin as the center of the 3 mics
                * find point in space of source or sound relative to origin

## old ideas

* neural net for arbitrary sound transformations
